Intro (ALGORITHM USED):


Our group has successfully implemented the maze builder and the initial setup of our maze using the Kruskal maze algorithm. We are currently able to generate a random maze on a forty by forty grid in black and white. We have spent a lot of time struggling with the bot and have had many different interactions with their own bugs.




Contents:


main.html        : The HTML file to be opened with a browser
main.js                : The Javascript file containing all the necessary code




External Requirements:


Standard compiler to run basic files types, JavaScript, HTML, and so forth.




Setup and Installation: 


Unzip program, and open “main.html” in a web browser, preferably Google Chrome




Sample Invocation:




Features:


Random maze generation is the main feature we were able to implement with only the beginnings of our bot. Therefore, a working bot is not entirely implemented.




Bugs:


Only shows final solution path




Issues:


Bot implementation is currently not working correctly. Could not figure out how to show bot testing which direction to go. Only showed the final solution.
